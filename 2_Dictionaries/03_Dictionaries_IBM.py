""" Text Analysis 
You have been recruited by your friend, a linguistics enthusiast, to create a utility tool that can
perform analysis on a given piece of text.

Constructor - takes argument 'text', makes it lower case and removes all punctuation, assume only the
following punctuation is used: period (.), exclamation mark (!), comma (,) and question mark (?).

freqAll - returns a dictionary of all unique words along with the number of their occurences.

freqOf - returns the frequency of the word passed in argument. """
